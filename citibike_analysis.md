## Limitations

Before launching the service, there are a few factors that we should consider:

1) NYC has a lot of missing data when it comes to gender.  A huge proportion of riders
are classified as unknown gender.

2) Gender is not the only driving factor behind usage of citi bike.  Is Des Moines a 
big tourist destination compared to NYC?  According to an article from Business Insider
[link](https://www.businessinsider.com/the-most-popular-us-states-for-tourism-2014-10),
NYC was ranked 5th most popular state to visit in the US, while Iowa was ranked 32nd.
